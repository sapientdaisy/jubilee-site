				<!-- making these two half width puts them next to each other on the page. -->
				<div class="half-width">
					<p>I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small
					growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism.
					As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I
					could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to
					build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="half-width">
					<p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I
					learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that
					gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve
					made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my
					organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

					<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
					<p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to
					make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate,
					trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

				<div class="third-width">
					<img alt="CSS icon" src="img/css-icon.png">
					<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
					<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I
					focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to
					stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

					<h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
					<p>You can trust me to take a designer’s PSD and quickly & accurately
					convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
